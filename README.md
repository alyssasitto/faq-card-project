## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to create a drop down effect using javascript which is something I didn't know how to do before. I also learned how to give the svg image a transition when I opened each accordion.

### Continued development

I am going to constinue learnig how to use absolute and relative positioning along with transitions/transformations. I'm also going to continue learning how to use Javascript since I have very little knowledge of it right now.
